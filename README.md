- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tuxzie, a college student curious about the ways computers work and how they process information.
- 👀 I’m interested in data structures, programming, and networking! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and C++ so I can better understand the fundamentals to coding. I have experience in Python but I really want to experiment with other languages and see what I like.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making games, web development, and cryptography. I am especially keen on web development and want to work on both backend and frontend aspects.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email: tuxziekc@gmail.com. I check my emails quite frequently and am open to constructive criticism.

Yes I'm a noob at coding so please bear with me as I make several mistakes and learn from them. Your constructive criticism is welcome!
I currently only have some experience with programming as a hobby and through online self-study. I hope to make it my major as I find programming
as rewarding as it is irritating sometimes.
