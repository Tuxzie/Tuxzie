Hello! I am just a college student trying to figure out IT, PC, and software-related stuff to learn from.

I have hands-on IT experience from: home-labbing, virtualization, setting up desktops, printers, monitors,
building PCs, dual-booting, etc. This is my profile and where I log what I've learned!

I am Bing Bong from the game Peak.
